                      A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been
                      previously identified. The virus causing coronavirus
                      disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the
                      coronaviruses that commonly circulate among
                      humans&nbsp;and cause mild illness, like the common cold.

                      A diagnosis with coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, or HKU1 is
                      not the same as a COVID-19 diagnosis. Patients with
                      COVID-19 will be evaluated and cared for differently than
                      patients with common coronavirus diagnosis.
